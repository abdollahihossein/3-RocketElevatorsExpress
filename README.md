What is Node.js?

Itâ€™s an open source cross platform JavaScript runtime environment that can execute code outside the browser. It allows developers to build server-side and network applications with JavaScript.


What is Express?

Express.js is a free and open-source web application framework for Node.js. It is used for designing and building web applications quickly and easily.


Give three reasons why Node.js Express?

1. Faster Server side development:
 Express.js provides many commonly used features of Node.js in the form of functions that can be readily used anywhere in the program. This removes the need to code for several hours and thus saves time.
2. Middleware:
 Middleware is a part of the program that has access to the database, client request, and the other middlewares. It is mainly responsible for the systematic organization of different functions of Express.js.
3. Routing:
 Express.js provides a highly advanced routing mechanism which helps to preserve the state of the webpage with the help of their URLs.
